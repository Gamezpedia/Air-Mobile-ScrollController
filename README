# Air Mobile Scroll Controller

Everything you need to have scrolling in your Adobe Air application that feels native on mobile.


# How to use

Add ScrollController.as, create a new ScrollController object, and call its addScrollControll() method.
See the documentation for the details.


# Note

Don't hesitate to play around with the scrolling parameters (static constants) and suggest values that feel
more native to you.
